# msop-fidem-lotterie

This is for the test of MSOP.

I only have 2hs to finish.
So first commit 1h, test 0.5h, and refactor 0.5h

There is a functionality to do: error message if all the numbers are selected.
Unit test covergae is about 95%, need 0.5h more to arrive 100%

Download and import to eclipse as eclipse project.
mvn eclipse:eclipse if eclipse does not have maven plugin
update maven project if eclipse have maven plugin.

Thank you.
